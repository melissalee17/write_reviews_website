        "opinion":"My friend saw this place on Vice Munchies and we tried it when I first moved to Austin. This place is insanely good. I like to get the pad kapow and mango sticky rice if they aren't sold out. You can only order online so I typically order before I leave the house and get the thai iced tea from Radio Coffee & Beer. If you go on the weekends, order before they even open because the wait can be around an hour if you don't. If you order during the week, it's normally a 10-20 minute wait so I try and go then.",
