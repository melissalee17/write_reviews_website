        "opinion":"Best casual Japanese food in Austin. It's a grocery store or I guess it would more accurately be called a konbini. I go almost weekly to get their bento boxes and onigiri on work days because of how convenient they are. They only sell their bento boxes Wednesday-Sunday so I recommend going on one of those days and calling ahead to order (if you're going to the Burnet location) so you don't have to wait. On Friday-Sunday they have soft serve at the Burnet location so try that if you're there on one of those days.",
